Therefore, many of the villains in the dataset did not have birthplaces or origin locations. However, as shown on the map, the ones that do are mostly located in New York and other parts of the world. The very first Captain America (Captain America #1) was published March 1, 1941. At this time, World War II was occurring . The cover of Captain America #1 shows the intrepid hero punching Adolf Hitler right in the face. Also, the scientist that created Captain America was Jewish. Captain America was created to spark national pride and become a figure everyone could unite around. In early Captain America comic books, readers were invited to join a fictional defense organization known as the Sentinels of Liberty. It was essentially a fan club of those who were willing to help Captain America in his struggle against “evil foreigners”. The club cost ten cents to join and required members to submit a signed document stating: “I solemnly pledge to uphold the principles of the Sentinels of Liberty and assist Captain America in his war against spies in the U.S.A.” Indeed this was a great way to capitalize on the current nationalist attitude at the time to sell comic books (Captain America Book)..<br></p>

The Red Skull is a nazi assassin that is fond of using poison and other trickery to kill his enemies. As seen on the map, the Red Skull is from Germany. His origins are meant to be unknown and therefore there is no specific city or location other than Germany (Captain America Book).     .

However, Magneto’s backstory is much more developed. MARVEL also places Magneto in the middle of World War II, except Magneto is a Jewish Hollocaust survivor. This “evil German” was not created to spark nationalism, but to give the character depth. Although Magneto was debuted in 1963, his origin story changed in 1975 when writer Chris Claremont took over the story direction of X-Men series. In an interview, Claremont states his reasoning behind recreating Magneto:<br><br>&nbsp;“I was trying to figure out what made Magneto tick...and I thought, what was the most transfiguring event of our century that would tie in the super-concept of the X-Men as persecuted outcasts? It has to be the Holocaust!...All the rest fell into place, because it allowed me to turn him into a tragic figure who wants to save his people. Magneto was defined by all that had happened to him” (From Maus t om Maus to Magnet o Magneto).<br></p>

His first appearance was in April of 1962 between the two most important moments of the Cold War: the Checkpoint Charlie standoff in October of 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October of 1962. His origin story involves the persecution of the Roma people or “gypsies” by Germany between 1936-1938. Dr. Doom’s father and mother were killed by Germans and Dr. Doom as a child vowed revenge on those who wronged him. As an adult, Doom combines science and magic to become a powerful being and eventually rules Latveria with an iron fist. His rise to power and fascist methods of rule are said to be molded after Stalin (http://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/14126/1/LatverianIncursions.pdf).</p>

Out of the 142 characters used in the dataset, 39 of them are from New York City. Arguably, the biggest names in MARVEL comics: X-Men, Spiderman, Captain America, Iron Man, and the Fantastic Four can be found in the Big Apple. MARVEL comic book writer Stan Lee can be thanked for this. In fact, many of the places described in MARVEL comics are based on real actual places in the city. Dr. Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum has a real address in Greenwich Village and the Avengers mansion was based on a Beaux-Arts palace on the Upper East Side. Stan Lee was born and raised in New York City and him as well as the people that worked at MARVEL also lived in the City. Other comic books spoke of fictional places like Metropolis and Gotham, and Stan Lee’s goal was to make comic books that were relatable. Stan Lee liked the idea of local superheroes like Spider-Man versus all-powerful heroes such as Superman. Due to the fact that the heroes were from actual real-life places also allowed writers to give them real life problems (for example being bullied) that readers could relate to. Also, MARVEL artist were able to draw what they were familiar with (streets, bridges, water towers) which gave the comics an authenticity that no other comics delivered. Another advantage of having so many heroes and villains in such close proximity is that they could interact with each other. Spider-Man could team up with the X-Men or the Fantastic Four in a special issue which often would boost sales https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/nyregion/stan-lee-death-nyc.html.<strong><br></strong></p>
