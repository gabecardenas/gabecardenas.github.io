She first appeared in 1961 (During the Silver Age of Comic Books 1961-1963) as the matriarch of the Fantastic Four. In the early 60’s, Sue played the role of the suburban housewife even though she was a super-powered human. She was frequently objectified for her beauty and body, frequently captured and in need of rescue,  and was often unappreciated in the male dominated MARVEL world. As early as February 1963, fans began demanding that Sue Storm become a more powerful character. In January of 1964, MARVEL introduced a character arc in which Sue is blasted with radioactive rays which unlocks new super powers for her: the ability to generate impenetrable force fields and the ability to project invisibility on others things and other people. This was described as a feminist fantasy: the idea that a woman could make a man invisible. These powers gave her the ability to be the strongest and most powerful member of the Fantastic Four (D'Amore 2008). (Image from Marvel.com)</p>

As the timeline shows, the introduction of female characters into the MARVEL universe had a huge spike during this period. This also correlates with the graphs shown below that display the growing numbers of women joining the labor force as well as serving in the U.S. House of Representatives during the same era.</p></div>

</strong><br>Arguably one of the most important characters in the MARVEL universe is Ororo Munroe, also known as Storm from the X-Men series. Although the feminism movement greatly improved the role of women in comic books in the 1970’s, it did not necessarily include black female characters. This trend changed when Storm made her first appearance in MARVEL comics in 1975 as displayed above in the timeline. Storm was the first relevant black female character to be published by a major comic book company. With the relaunch of the New X-Men in 1975, a new team of international and multi-ethnic characters were given complex origin stories and were more culturally diverse with different worldviews. Storm was born in New York City and was the daughter of an African princess. Her family moved to Africa when she was six, and discovered her powers as a teenager while living there. An ancient African priestess taught Storm how to use and control her powers and there she was treated as a goddess. Storm was unique in that her moniker did not involve terms such as “girl”, “woman”, or “lady”. In the 80’s under the direction of Chris Claremont, Storm wore her hair in a mohawk and wore leather clothes. Feminist author Selma Regina Nunes Oliveira claims that Storm’s sexual and gender identities are associated with her hairstyle. Female comic book characters with long flowing hair tend to be identified as more feminine and female characters with short hair are identified to be more masculine. During Storm’s “mohawk phase”, she established a relationship with another female character, Yukio, which brought Storm’s sexuality and gender identity into question, making Storm possibly one of the first LGBTQ female MARVEL characters. In her 40 or so years of existence Storm was also romantically involved with Forge (Indigenous American), Wolverine (white), Nightcrawler (white), and Khan (alien). In over 60 years and over 1,000 characters there have only been ten interracial couples that involved a black person. Storm was a key figure in both feminism, and race relations. Beyond this, Storm is an established leader in the MARVEL universe. At times she was team leader of the X-Men, leader of the Morlocks (an outcasted mutant group that lives underground), and even replaced Mr. Fantastic and Sue Storm as leader of the Fantastic Four at one point. Also, with the exception of the Morlocks, these groups are comprised nearly entirely of white men (Dalbeto and Oliveira 2015). (Image from www.comicsgrid.com/articles/10.5334/cg.bd/) &nbsp;<br></p>

In males, the muscles grew bigger, the necks thickened, and the head became smaller. Regarding women, their legs became longer, their breasts were drawn bigger than their heads, and their clothing became tighter and smaller (Robbins 2002) According to the data set, the average weight of a human-sized female MARVEL character is 124 pounds. According to the CDC, the average weight of an American woman is 170 pounds as of 2019 ("FastStats Body Measurements" 2019). These stats clearly highlight how comic book readership is heavily male dominated and influenced. (Image from Marvel.com)<br><br></p>
