</strong></p><p>
Dataset:&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The information for these datasets was derived from https://www.superherodb.com/</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The datasets used for this project were two Excel spreadsheets I found on kaggle.com, from the collection entitled “Super Heroes Dataset”. One spreadsheet listed the character’s descriptive and physical properties such as name, gender, eye color, race (human, alien, mutant, Asgardian etc), hair color, height, weight, publisher, skin color (not involving race, more like whether their skin was blue, green or red), and moral alignment (good or bad/evil). The other spreadsheet listed the same names of the characters on the other document, as well as stated “true” or “false” on regarding whether or not they possessed any of the 193 superpowers listed. The creator of these datasets states that the inspiration for creating these sets was his favorite characteristics from superheroes. What attracted me to these datasets was the thoroughness of the amount of super powers listed. I too was curious about the relationships between superpowers and the characters that possessed them. Are there any patterns and are there any imbalances amongst male characters and female characters? I also wanted to learn more about where superheroes were from and the history of female superheroes in comic books.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Regarding the sources for my text I was able to find multiple scholarly articles via Google Scholar that addressed the controversies of comic book character dynamics when it comes to gender, historical influences, and socio-political movements. I also found many magazine articles and online articles that helped me explicate my visual information.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Images for the website were gathered from: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; www.wikipedia.org &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; www.marvel.fandom.com &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; www.marvel.com &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; www.revengeofthefans.com (Opening Timeline Image) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; www.kickassfacts.com (Home Page) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Processed
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This dataset required a large amount of cleaning due to its size. First, I used OpenRefine to execute a text facet in the publisher column of the descriptive spreadsheet to eliminate all the heroes and villains that were not published by MARVEL Comics. This eliminated all the characters from DC Comics (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman etc) as well as heroes and villains from Star Wars and other popular movies and television shows. From there, I used OpenRefine to find characters that did not have a “true” value in any of the superpower columns. These were auxiliary characters from the MARVEL movies and comics such as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that I was not particularly interested in because they were non-powered humans with no special abilities. The MARVEL universe contains multiple dimensions and timelines which causes multiple versions of the same character. For example, the spreadsheet listed three different Spider-Mans so I manually deleted duplicates of the same character and kept the versions I would associate as the most well-known to most people. I did the same for the characters that had multiple aliases, for example Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel are the same person. I executed these processes with both the descriptive spreadsheet and powers spreadsheet so that they both had the same characters in the name column. Once this was achieved, I was able to combine the two spreadsheets into one very large spreadsheet that had the pertinent data I needed for my project. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">As soon as I had everything on one document, proceeded to fill in some of the missing information in order to have consistent data throughout the set. If a character’s moral alignment was not listed or their location was unclear, I researched them on websites such as www.wikipedia.org, marvel.fandom.com, and MARVEL.com. Between these three websites, I was able to find all the information I needed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I also added some columns to the dataset that would help me create the data visualizations for my project. Although, the “TRUE” and “FALSE” descriptions were helpful to determine which characters had which powers, I knew I needed to quantify them numerically. I used the search function in Excel to figure out how many “TRUE” boxes each character had in their column and created a “Number of Powers” column in the sheet that showed how many powers each character had in whole numbers. I used OpenRefine to count how many “true” tags were in each column to determine how many characters had each power. I used this data to create the word clouds in the project. I also created a “Year First Appeared” column in order to create the timeline. I was able to find the dates each character first appeared through the three websites listed above.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The map was challenging because multiple characters are from the same locations, especially New York City. Tableau Public does not allow multiple points at the same location so I had to manually enter latitude and longitude coordinates in order to space out the dots on the map. I used https://www.latlong.net/ to do this. Also, some of the locations in the MARVEL universe are fictional (for example Latveria for Dr. Doom) so I did some research online via the three referenced websites to approximate the locations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Presented</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>
</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The website was created using Mobirise (https://mobirise.co/) </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Character Location map and bar graph were done using Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Timeline was created using knightlab (https://timeline.knightlab.com/) and the information blurbs and pictures for the timeline were pulled from Wikipedia. The pictures are hosted on flickr.com.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Word clouds were generated using the word cloud generator from https://wordart.com&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Bubble graph was designed using https://rawgraphs.io/&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Network graph comparing the powers of Captain Marvel and Thanos was made with the Cytoscape network visualization tool (https://cytoscape.org/)</span></p></div>
